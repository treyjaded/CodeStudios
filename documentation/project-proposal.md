### üöÄ Problem Statement

- My audience are designers and visual artists who want show off their work.
- The application allows the user to create online portfolios and interact with other designers.
- Users would use the application because of it‚Äôs dynamic design and accessibility to designers looking to share their portfolio.

*Example:* Our application would mainly serve individuals with disability or mobility issues under financial or physical constraints. A priority would be those who live in underprivileged communities, conflict-affected areas, or communities with limited healthcare infrastructure. Our product will leverage the power of technology and community collaboration to make assistive devices more accessible and affordable to those in need. This is done by connecting individuals to a network of builders who facilitate the creation and distribution of affordable, 3D-printed devices.
